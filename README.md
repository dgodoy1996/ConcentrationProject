# <CONCENTRATION>

Concentration is a fun game to test your brain! Click on 2 cards at a time to see if the emojis on the cards are a match. If they are a match then they will remain open, but if they're not a match you have another chance to find the correct card! You just have to try to find all of them before the timer runs out! If you find all the matches before the timer runs out then you win. If the timer runs out and you didn't find all the matches then you lose! You can always play again by hitting the play button to start a new game!
